## Description
This social network application API allows users to add friends, post their thoughts, and react to their friendsâ€™ thoughts. Express.js was used for routing, and MongoDB database and Mongoose ODM were used for storing the data.

## Usage
Since this is a backend web application, you must have node.js installed on your machine. You will also need a package.json with the required dependencies. Before installing dependencies, run "npm init" to create a package.json file. Also before installing npm dependencies, make sure you have a .gitignore file that includes node_modules/ and .DS_Store/. Then run "npm i" to install dependencies. 

To initialize the social network web API, type "npm run start" in the command line. Use a program like Insomnia to test your routes.

The images below show sample routes for users in Insomnia (see the video walkthrough to view all routes):
